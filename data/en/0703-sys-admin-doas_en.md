## Doas - Alternative to Sudo

We, the siduction team, have decided to use a real root account and have not configured Sudo. For users who are used to Sudo and don't want to do without its functionality, the slim alternative Doas is a good choice. Doas is tailored to desktop systems, having only about 1/100 of code lines in comparison to Sudo. With *siduction 2021.3 wintersky*, Doas is automatically installed in version 6.8.1-3, but is not yet fully configured.

### Configure Doas

The only thing missing to be able to use Doas is the configuration file *`/etc/doas.conf`*. It contains line-by-line rules that assign actions to a user. A `#` introduces comments. Doas reads the lines one after the other, executing the action of the last applicable rule. To understand the rules in the configuration file, there are a few things to keep in mind.  
- Only actions for which at least one rule applies are executed.
- By the fact that Doas evaluates the rules line by line one after the other, hierarchies can be built up.
- For rules that contain commands with arguments, the arguments must be specified exactly and completely.
- Rules with commands that require variable arguments are not possible.
- Doas checks the syntax of the configuration file before executing the requested action. In case of incorrect rules, Doas outputs `doas: syntax error at line 4` and then exits. The write access to the configuration file is then only possible with the **root** account.

The configuration is particularly simple if only one user account exists on the siduction system. A single line is sufficient to execute commands with root privileges using the prefix "doas ".  
Log in to a terminal as **root** and execute the following command, replacing "tux" with the name of your user account. 

~~~
tux@sidu:~$ su
Password:
root@sidu:/home/tux# echo "permit keepenv nopass tux" > /etc/doas.conf
root@sidu:/home/tux# exit
tux@sidu:~$
~~~

The configuration line consists of:  
The action *permit|deny* with  
the option *keepenv* (this allows to start graphical programs like *gparted*),  
the option *nopass|persist* (no password request|the one-time password entry remains valid for a limited time), and  
the user *tux* to which the action is to be applied.

If the username stands alone, **tux** may execute commands as any user present on the system. The default is **root**. If the execution of the action is to be allowed only with the rights of a user other than **root**, the name must be specified within the rule (e.g. *tux as anne*). Instead of the user, a group (e.g. *:vboxusers*) can gain permissions by prepending a **`:`**.

### Doas and multiple users

**Example**  
On the workstation PC, in addition to **tux**, three other users named **anne**, **bob**, and **lisa** are allowed to log in.  
Anne only wants to allow Bob to run two of her scripts from her **/home** directory. Anne has restrictively set the permissions on her scripts to 700.  
Lisa is especially trustworthy, so she should be in charge of system upgrades.

Now, as user **tux**, we use Doas in a terminal to edit the configuration file.

~~~
tux@sidu:~$ doas mcedit /etc/doas.conf
~~~

We convert the previously mentioned permissions into rules and add some comments to the file.

~~~
# doas config file /etc/doas.conf

# tux gets root privileges
permit keepenv nopass tux

# bob may execute anne's script
permit bob as anne cmd /home/anne/bin/script1 args -n
permit bob as anne cmd /home/anne/bin/script2 args

# lisa may execute system upgrade
permit persist lisa cmd init
deny lisa cmd init args 1
deny lisa cmd init args 5
permit persist lisa cmd apt args update
permit persist lisa cmd apt args full-upgrade
~~~

**Explanations**  
**bob** may execute the scripts *script1* and *script2* inside Anne's **/home/anne/bin** directory (the former exclusively with the argument *-n*, the latter must not be given any argument). Specifying *args* in the rule line for the *script2* without a following argument forces the file to be called without an argument and thus without potentially malicious code. **bob** must supply the username when calling scripts, using the *-u* option.

~~~
bob@sidu:~$ doas -u anne /home/anne/bin/script1 -n
doas (bob@sidu) password:

bob@sidu:~$
~~~

The script was executed without comment after Bob entered his user password.

To allow **Lisa** to perform the system upgrade, she should switch to *multi-user.target* (init 3) and perform a *systemctl reboot* (init 6) after completion. The rule line `permit persist lisa as root cmd init` without specifying *args* causes all other calls of init are allowd, except those that are prohibited by the following rules below. Therefore, she cannot go directly from the *multi-user.target* to the *graphical.target* (init 5). Here we see the structure of a hierarchy.

**Notes**  
If you keep typing *sudo*, the line `alias sudo="doas"` in your *.bashrc* will help.  
Doas plays its decisive advantage where only one user is granted root rights by *doas*. The above example with Lisa shows how extensive the configuration for a restricted rights assignment can become. Furthermore, a rule for a program call with variable arguments (e.g. *apt install \<package name\>*) is not possible.
