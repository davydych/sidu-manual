% LAMP - Apache 

## Set up Apache

This manual page is based on Apache 2.4.46.

According to our example from the installation guide, we want to set up a *LAMP test server for developers* that is directly connected to the workstation PC via LAN. Beyond that, for security reasons, there should be no connection for the server to a local network or even to the Internet.  
The only exception is that the server will be connected to the Internet temporarily and exclusively for system and software updates via a second network interface.

### Apache in the file system

Debian has fully integrated the Apache files into the file system according to their function:

+ the executable program *apache2* into `/usr/sbin/`
+ the installed modules for Apache into `/usr/lib/apache2/modules/`
+ files that are also available to other programs into `/usr/share/apache2/`
+ the configuration directories and files into `/etc/apache2/`
+ the web page created by the user into `/var/www/html/`
+ system files required at runtime into `/run/apache2/`, `/run/lock/apache2/`
+ various log files into `/var/log/apache2/`

It is important to distinguish between the variables `ServerRoot` and `DocumentRoot`.

**ServerRoot** is the configuration directory, i.e. `/etc/apache2/`.  
**DocumentRoot** contains the web page data, so `/var/www/html/`.

### Connection to the server

The connection between the test server and the PC is placed in the IPv4 network segment **192.168.3.xxx**, while the PC's Internet connection is outside this network segment. The data used are:

**server**  
IP: 192.168.3.1/24  
name: server1.org  
alias: www.server1.org

**PC**  
IP: 192.168.3.10/24  
name: pc1

We make a backup copy of the `*/etc/hosts*` file on the server and on the PC and add the necessary lines to both.

+ server `*/etc/hosts*`:

  ~~~
  cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts_$(date +%f)
  echo "192.168.3.1 server1.org www.server1.org" >> /etc/hosts
  echo "192.168.3.10 pc1" >> /etc/hosts
  ~~~

+ PC `*/etc/hosts*`:

  ~~~
  cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts_$(date +%f)
  echo "192.168.3.1 server1.org www.server1.org" >> /etc/hosts
  ~~~

Next, in *NetworkManager*, we enter the data for the server in the fields outlined in red. The method is changed from *"Automatic (DHCP)"* to *"Manual"* and in the address fields we enter the values mentioned at the beginning.

![Server - Data entry in NetworkManager](./images-en/lamp-apache/server_lan.png)

Additionally, in the tab *"General"*, the option *"Automatically connect with priority"* should be activated.  
Accordingly, we set the appropriate settings on the PC for the used LAN interface.

On the PC, we test the connection in the console with

~~~
$ ping -c3 www.server1.org
~~~

and, if successful, we immediately check the function of Apache by entering http://www.server1.org/index.html in the address line of the web browser.

The Apache welcome page with *"It works!"* should appear.

### Apache configuration

The configuration files and directories are located in the `ServerRoot` directory `/etc/apache2/`.  
The central configuration file is `apache2.conf`. It is usually not edited because many configurations are in separate files. Activation and deactivation is done via sym links. This has the advantage that a number of different configurations are available and only the required ones are included.

The configuration files are text files, which are created or edited with an editor and **root** permissions. The name of the file may be arbitrary, but the file extension must be *".conf"*. The valid directives that may be used in the configuration files are described in detail in the [Apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/).

The files are located in the directories 

`/etc/apache2/conf-available`,  
`/etc/apache2/mods-available`, and  
`/etc/apache2/sites-available`.

Your activation links can be found in

`/etc/apache2/conf-enable`,  
`/etc/apache2/mods-enable`, and  
`/etc/apache2/sites-enable`.

To enable or disable a *".conf"* file, we use `a2enconf` and `a2disconf`. This creates or removes the activation links. The command

~~~
a2enconf NAME_OF_FILE.conf 
~~~

activates the configuration. Deactivation is done accordingly with:

~~~
a2disconf NAME_OF_FILE.conf 
~~~

We proceed in the same way for modules and virtual hosts with the commands `a2enmod`, `a2ensite` and `a2dismod`, `a2dissite`.

The Apache web server reads the changed configuration with the command

~~~
systemctl reload apache2.service
~~~


Now we return to our *LAMP test server for developers* and adjust the configuration to the server data.

1. `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file

   It is one of the few exceptions for editing the `apache2.conf`. We add the following line at the beginning of the *"Global configuration"* section:

	~~~
	ServerName 192.168.3.1
	~~~

   This tells the Apache web server the IP address where the development project should be reachable and suppresses redirections to IP 127.0.1.1 with error messages.

2. New `sites` file

   With the text editor of our choice, we create the file  
   `/etc/apache2/sites-available/server1.conf`, e.g.

	~~~
	mcedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/server1.conf
	~~~

	Then we insert the following content, save the file, and exit the editor.

	~~~
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName server1.org
	ServerAlias www.server1.org
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error_server1.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access_server1.log combined
	</VirtualHost>
	~~~

	Then we change the configuration to the new *VirtualHost* and announce the changes to the Apache web server:

~~~
# a2ensite server1.conf 
   Enabling site server1.
[...]

# a2dissite 000-default.conf 
   Site 000-default disabled.
[...]

systemctl reload apache2.service
~~~

### Users and permissions

The Apache web server runs with the USER.GROUP *www-data.www-data*" and `DocumentRoot` belongs to *"root.root"* immediately after installation.  
To give users write permissions to the files contained in `DocumentRoot`, a new group should be created specifically for this purpose. It does not make sense to use the existing group *www-data* because Apache runs with the rights of this group.  
We name the new group `work`.

**With CMS**

If a content management system (software for collaborative editing of website content) is added, we prepare `DocumentRoot` accordingly:

1. Create the group and assign it to the user.

	~~~
	groupadd work
	adduser USERNAME work
	chgrp work /var/www/html
	~~~

To activate the new permissions you have to log out and log in again, or use the `newgrp` command as user.

   ~~~
   $ newgrp work
   ~~~

2. Set SGID bit for `DocumentRoot`  
   so that all added directories and files inherit the group `work`.

   ~~~
   chmod g+s /var/www/html
   ~~~

3. Adjust owner and file permissions  
   so that unauthorized people don't get access and the Apache web server runs properly.  
   Let's look at the current permissions:

   ~~~
   # ls -la /var/www/html
   total 24
   drwxr-sr-x 2 root work 4096 Jan 9 19:32 .
                (DocumentRoot with SGID bit)
   drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan 9, 19:04 ...
                (The parent directory /var/www)
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root work 10701 9 Jan 19:04 index.html
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root work 20 Jan 9, 19:32 info.php
   ~~~

   For `DocumentRoot` we change the owner to *"www-data"*, give write permission to the group, and revoke read permission from everyone else as well (all recursively).

   ~~~
   chown -R www-data /var/www/html
   chmod -R g+w /var/www/html
   chmod -R o-r /var/www/html
   ~~~

   We check the result again.

   ~~~
   # ls -la /var/www/html
   total 24
   dr-xrws--x 2 www-data work 4096 Jan 9 19:32 .
   drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan 9 19:04 ...
   -rw-rw---- 1 www-data work 10701 9 Jan 19:04 index.html
   -rw-rw---- 1 www-data work 20 9 Jan 19:32 info.php
   ~~~

   Now only members of the group *work* have write permission in `DocumentRoot`. Apache web server can read and write the files, all others are denied access.

4. Disadvantages of these settings

   When creating new directories and files below `DocumentRoot`, the owner is the respective **user** and not *www-data*. This prevents the Apache web server from reading the files.  
   The solution is a *Systemd Path Unit*, which monitors changes below `DocumentRoot` and adjusts the owner and file permissions. (See the example in the [Systemd-Path](0715-systemd-path_en.md#systemd-path) manual page.)

**Without CMS**

For static websites, a content management system is often not necessary and only constitutes another security risk and increased maintenance effort. In addition to the settings made before, the write permission to `DocumentRoot` can be revoked from the Apache web server to strengthen security because in case an attacker finds a hole in Apache, this will not give him write permission to `DocumentRoot`.

~~~
chmod -R u-w /var/www/html
~~~

### Security - Apache Standard

Important safeguards are already included in the file `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` by default.

The following three directives prevent access to the root file system and then release the two directories used by the Apache web server, "/usr/share" and "/var/www".

~~~
<Directory />
	Options FollowSymLinks
	AllowOverride None
	Require all denied
</directory>

<Directory /usr/share>
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
</directory>

<Directory /var/www/>
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
</directory>
~~~

The options *"FollowSymLinks"* and *"Indexes"* constitute a security risk and should be changed unless absolutely necessary. See below.

The following directive disables the display of the files `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd`.

~~~
<FilesMatch "^\.ht">
	Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
~~~

### Security - other configurations

+ In the file **/etc/apache2/apache2.conf**:

  **FollowSymLinks** may cause content outside `DocumentRoot` to be listed.  
  **Indexes** lists the contents of a directory if there is no `index.html` or `index.php`, etc..

  It is recommended to remove *"FollowSymLinks"* and place all the project data below *"DocumentRoot"*. For the *"Indexes"* option, the entry has to be changed to

  ~~~
  Options -Indexes
  ~~~

  if the display of the directory contents is **not** desired.  
  Alternatively, create an empty *index* file in the directory that is delivered to the client in place of the directory contents. For example, for the `upload` directory:

  ~~~
  $ echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > /var/www/html/upload/index.html
       or
  $ echo "<?php" > /var/www/html/upload/index.php
  ~~~

+ In the host configuration  
  `/etc/apache2/sites-available/server1.conf`

  we can use the `<Directory>` block to block all IP addresses except those listed in it.

  ~~~
  <Directory "/var/www/html">
	  Order deny,allow
	  Deny from all
	  Allow from 192.168.3.10
	  Allow from 192.168.3.1
  </directory>
  ~~~

+ **Merging** the configuration:

  The directives of the configuration are spread over a number of files within `ServerRoot` and the `.htaccess` files in `DocumentRoot`. It is therefore particularly important to know where to place the directive to achieve the desired effect.  
  We strongly recommend to consult the web page  
  [apache.org - How the sections are merged](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/sections.html#merging)  
  intensively.

+ The **owner** of `DocumentRoot`

  is *"root.root"* after installation and should be changed. See the chapter [users and permissions](0521-lamp-apache_en.md#users-and-permissions).

### Use HTTPS

Without HTTPS no website project can be launched today.  
How to obtain a certificate is described, for example, in detail and in an easy-to-understand manner on the website [wpbeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-get-a-free-ssl-certificate-for-your-wordpress-website/).

First we create the necessary folders inside `DocumentRoot`:

~~~
cd /etc/apache2/
/etc/apache2/# mkdir ssl ssl/certs ssl/private
~~~

In these we put the certificate file `server1.org.crt` and the private key `server1.org.key`.

Then we secure the directories against unauthorized access.

~~~
/etc/apache2/# chown -R root.root ssl
/etc/apache2/# chmod -R o-rwx ssl
/etc/apache2/# chmod -R g-rwx ssl
/etc/apache2/# chmod u-w ssl/certs/server1.org.crt
/etc/apache2/# chmod u-w ssl/private/server1.org.key
~~~

Finally, we use the `ls` command to check:

~~~
/etc/apache2/# ls -la ssl
   total 20
   drwx------ 5 root root 4096 Jan 25 18:17 .
   drwxr-xr-x 9 root root 4096 Jan 25 18:43 ...
   drwx------ 2 root root 4096 Jan 25 18:16 certs
   drwx------ 2 root root 4096 Jan 25 18:16 private

/etc/apache2/# ls -l ssl/certs
   -r-------- 1 root root 1216 25 Jan 15:27 server1.org.crt
~~~

### Security Tips

+ The Apache documentation contains a recommended page with various security tips.  
  [apache.org - Security Tips](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/misc/security_tips.html)

+ In addition, there are numerous tips on the Internet for the secure operation of the Apache web server.

+ Regular checking of the log files in `/var/log/apache2/` helps to detect errors or security holes.

+ If the server is connected to the local network or to the Internet in a different way than intended in this manual page, a firewall is essential.

### Integration in Apache2

The ssl module is activated in Apache by default. It is enough to edit the file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/server1.conf`.

+ Insert a new VirtualHost directive at the beginning. This redirects incoming client requests from port 80 to port 443 (ssl) using *"Redirect"*.

+ Rewrite the previous VirtualHost directive to port 443.

+ Add the SSL directives after the standard host directives.

+ In case our web project should contain dynamically generated web pages, the last two *"FileMatch"* and *"Directory"* directives need to be inserted with the *"SSLOptions"* directive.

The extended `server1.conf` then has the following content:

~~~
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName server1.org
    ServerAlias www.server1.org
    Redirect / https://server1.org/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName server1.org
    ServerAlias www.server1.org
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error_server1.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access_server1.log combined

    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/certs/server1.org.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/private/server1.org.key

    <Directory "/var/www/html">
    	Order deny,allow
    	Deny from all
    	Allow from 192.168.3.10
    	Allow from 192.168.3.1
    </directory>

    <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
    	SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
    </FilesMatch>

    <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
    	SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
~~~

In case our finished project is to be located at a hoster without access to `ServerRoot` (this is the rule), we can add a rewrite statement to the `.htaccess` file in `DocumentRoot` or create the file with the rewrite statement.

~~~
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</IfModule>
~~~
